						description: 	'You spent so much time playing that online game, you not only mastered it, you were master over the other players. You were powerful. They praised you, they needed you, or at least, you thought they did. Guess you were wrong. So, what do you do now that the virtual world you dedicated your life to got unplugged and ripped away?

Set against the Midwest paradigm of Columbus, Ohio, PLOX is the story of Chad, the raid leader with no patience, Roy, the rational one that would rather play with dice and paper, and Kim, the guild leader at the end of her rope.

Without irony or prejudice, PLOX celebrates the subculture of gaming - video, card, and tabletop - while exploring how the shroud of internet anonymity changes our real world relationships and identities.',
